# badtranslator
A very bad translator for creating funny texts based on LibreTranslate. Translates a text x times into a random language.

HOW TO SETUP:
1. Download and intall the Docker Daemon. See https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
2. Setup LibreTranslate using CLI:
   - ```docker run -ti -p 5000:5000 libretranslate/libretranslate```
   - Depending on your internet connection, it might take 5-15 minutes to download all the languages.
3. Run my code.

Enjoy!
